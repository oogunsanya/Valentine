    <h1>Will You Be My Valentine?</h1>
    <p>Just wanted to drop a quick note to let you know how much you mean to me. Like, seriously, you're the absolute best thing that's ever happened to me. You bring so much light into my life, it's crazy.

Every time I'm with you, it's like everything else just fades away, and all that matters is us. Your laugh? It's like my favorite song playing on repeat. And your smile? It's the kind of thing that makes even the worst days feel like a walk in the park.

You're not just my girlfriend, you know? You're my partner in crime, my rock, my everything. You've got this way of making me feel like I can take on the world, and for that, I'm forever grateful.

I want you to know that you're always on my mind, whether we're together or miles apart. You've got this hold on my heart that's stronger than anything I've ever known, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
